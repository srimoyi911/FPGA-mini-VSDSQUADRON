#Step 1: Understanding the Verilog Code

Access the Verilog code from the provided link: https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/top.v

Review the module declaration and understand the purpose of each input and output port:

led_red, led_blue, led_green (Output): Control the RGB LED

hw_clk (Input): Hardware oscillator clock input

testwire (Output): Test signal output

Analyze the internal components:

Internal Oscillator (SB_HFOSC) instantiation

Frequency counter logic driven by the internal oscillator

RGB LED driver instantiation with defined current parameters

Create a brief documentation explaining the functionality of the Verilog code, including:

Purpose of the module

Description of internal logic and oscillator

Functionality of the RGB LED driver and its relationship to the outputs

#Step 2: Creating the PCF File

Access the PCF file from the provided link: https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/VSDSquadronFM.pcf

Understand the pin assignments from the PCF file:

led_red -> Pin 39

led_blue -> Pin 40

led_green -> Pin 41

hw_clk -> Pin 20

testwire -> Pin 17

Cross-reference the pin assignments with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board datasheet to verify the correctness of the assignments.

Document the pin mapping and explain the significance of each connection in context with the Verilog code and board hardware.

#Step 3: Integrating with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board

Review the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board datasheet to understand its features and pinout.

Use the datasheet to correlate the physical board connections with the PCF file and Verilog code.

Connect the board to the computer as described in the datasheet (e.g., using USB-C and ensuring FTDI connection).

Follow the provided Makefile (https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/Makefile) for building and flashing the Verilog code:

Run 'make clean' to clear any previous builds

Run 'make build' to compile the design

Run 'sudo make flash' to program the FPGA board

Observe the behavior of the RGB LED on the board to confirm successful programming.

#Step 4: Final Documentation

Compile all observations, explanations, and steps into a comprehensive report.

Include:

Summary of the Verilog code functionality

Pin mapping details from the PCF file

Integration steps and observations while working with the FPGA Mini board

Challenges faced and solutions implemented

Submit the final document along with the working Verilog and PCF files.

Document all of these in a GitHub repo.
